           <p>Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Wishpik website ("Site") operated by Wishpik ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Site is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Site.</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Site you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Site.</p>

<h3>Subscription</h3>

<p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>

<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Wishpik cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Wishpik customer support team.</p>

<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Wishpik with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Wishpik to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

<p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, [Your Company Name] will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>

We reserve the right to terminate the account of anyone found to be infringing on a copyright.</p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
